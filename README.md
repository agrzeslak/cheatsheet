**Disclaimer:** This cheatsheet is a conglomeration of smaller cheatsheets and individual commands I've found useful in the past. If the command/technique is unique to a specific source, I've tried to cite it within the page. If there are any sources I've forgotten to list, please let me know!

To run locally: `jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ''`
